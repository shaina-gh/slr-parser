# SLR Parser in C++

## üéØ Aim

The aim of this project is to implement an **SLR (Simple LR)** parser in C++ to construct a parsing table for a given grammar and determine whether a string belongs to the language generated by the grammar.

## üß† Explanation and Logic

An SLR parser is a type of bottom-up parser used in compiler design. This program:
1. Takes grammar rules as input.
2. Computes **FIRST** and **FOLLOW** sets for all non-terminals.
3. Builds canonical LR(0) item sets and constructs the SLR parsing table.
4. Parses an input string based on the table to verify its validity.

### Key Concepts Implemented:
- **LR(0) Item Construction:** Augments the grammar and generates item sets.
- **Goto Function:** Computes transitions between states.
- **FIRST and FOLLOW Sets:** Determines symbols that can appear at the beginning or follow derivations.
- **SLR Table Generation:** Builds action and goto tables.
- **Shift-Reduce Parsing:** Parses the string using a stack to simulate state transitions.

## üî¢ Sample Input/Output

### Input
```yaml
Enter the number of productions:
4
enter LHS of production: S
enter RHS of production: AB
enter LHS of production: S
enter RHS of production: BC
enter LHS of production: A
enter RHS of production: a
enter LHS of production: B
enter RHS of production: b

Enter the string:
ab
```
### Output
```yaml
first(S) = { a }
first(A) = { a }
first(B) = { b }
follow(S) = { $ }
follow(A) = { b }
follow(B) = { $ }

Sets are:
I0 { X -> .S S -> .AB S -> .BC A -> .a B -> .b }
...

Table:
| a b $ S A B
0 | 3 4 1 2 5
...

$0
$0a3
$0a3b4
...

Accepted
```

## üåç Real-World Applications

- **Compilers:** SLR parsing is foundational for compiler syntax analysis.
- **Interpreters:** Helps evaluate expressions and programs written in formal languages.
- **Language Design:** Used in the early stages of programming language development to test grammar.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project showcases how context-free grammars can be systematically analysed using SLR parsing to automate syntax checking in language processors.
